As a typical accountant, I am an introvert. I like to be with my own thoughts and admire the beauty in my surroundings. Although I do not talk much, I am a great listener and a loyal friend."},

            {type: "paragraph", content: "I take great joy in planning my trips and spending countless hours researching on various sites. My conversations with people would often lead to talking about their future travels or where I can get the best food. I am always opened to new recommendations and love participating in discussions on where I can get the best _______."},
            {type: "paragraph", content: "I needed a place to store my itineraries and notes, as well as, my recommendations and details of my experiences. I was tired of sharing Google Drive documents with everyone as it doesn’t consist of any travel photos but mere names of places. I wanted people to see the pictures I took so everyone can have a better understanding of what I am talking about. Through all my research and adventures, I have learned which places are a must see and which I would suggest avoiding and want to share them with the world."},
            {type: "paragraph", content: "Thus, the idea of a blog was born."},
            {type: "paragraph", content: "A friend once said to me “Don’t let your dreams, be dreams”. So what the hell, here I am, trying to make a dream come true."},
            {type: "paragraph", content: "I am working on creating valuable content for my friends and fellow travelers. Since this is still a work in progress, please bear with me. This blog is in no way intended to be works of art, a literature essay…but my candid thoughts. I just want to share my thoughts, experiences, and excitement with everyone in the simplest way possible."},
            {type: "paragraph", content: "Now, less talk, more food and adventures."},
            {type: "paragraph", content: "Thank you for your support. I hope to see you again soon!"}
